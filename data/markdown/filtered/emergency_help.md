# 🚨 Module 4: Emergency & Safety Help

### 📞 1. National Emergency Numbers (24/7)
India has unified emergency numbers that work across all states.

* **112:** **ALL-IN-ONE Emergency** (Police, Fire, Ambulance). This is the equivalent of 911 in the US or 999 in the UK.
* **100:** Police (Direct line)
* **108:** Ambulance / Medical Emergency
* **101:** Fire Brigade

### 👮 2. Special Helplines
* **1363:** **Tourist Helpline** (Multi-lingual support for foreigners).
* **1091:** Women in Distress Helpline.
* **1098:** Child Helpline.
* **1033:** Road Accident / Highway Helpline.

### 🏥 3. What to do in a Medical Emergency?
* **Government Hospitals:** Provide low-cost or free emergency care. Look for "Civil Hospital" or "Government Medical College" in your area.
* **Private Hospitals:** Generally offer faster service and better facilities but require payment or insurance.
* **Ambulance:** Dial **108** for a government ambulance. Private hospitals often have their own ambulance numbers.

### 🚗 4. Road Accident Protocol (Good Samaritan Law)
If you witness an accident or are involved in one:
* **No Harassment:** Under the **Good Samaritan Guidelines**, bystanders who help accident victims **cannot** be forced to reveal their identity or be detained by the police.
* **Hospital Duty:** Hospitals **must** provide immediate First Aid / stabilization treatment to accident victims without waiting for police clearance (Supreme Court Order).

### 📄 5. Lost Passport / Documents
* **Step 1:** Immediately file a **"Lost Report"** or **FIR (First Information Report)** at the nearest police station. You cannot get a new visa/passport without this police report.
* **Step 2:** Contact your country's **Embassy or Consulate**.
* **FRRO:** You may need to visit the **Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO)** to update your visa status after getting a new passport.
